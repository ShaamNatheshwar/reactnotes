first there was only js
each browsers render it differently
so then came jquery which enhanced and had a 
single syntax for stuffs

so there was many js files inorder to overcome that
they came up with backbone.js

so later people started using js and code ina 
single page

jst without changing pages we were able to update the code



before react
there was imperative coding where we have to code
everything manually even manipulating the dom

in react we need not touch the dom
it will do everything for us

1) dont touch the dom
2) uses stuffs like lego block simply flutter
3) one way data code

functions receives some kinda input and process it as a html
but inside javascript

every component is built from the function

html inside js - jsx
it creates a dom called virtual DOM

see we will give the state on what we wanna built
then write html code in js called jsx
so react understand and builds virtual Dom which acts as a blue print
so react build stuffs

react is jst a ui library
angular is like everything it has all toolstuff
so its upto us we have to choose our own stack




npx allows us to use react without installing


npm and yarn
yarn is a better package manager
fb created yarn


see its difficult to create a react project on our own

so fb has created something called create-react-app


creating a react app using
npx

npx create-react-app <appName>


npm is used to leverage these products we can use anyone library and package
npm install -g create-react-app
npm install create-react-app for global and local installation respectively

how to delete a package
 npm uninstall -g cowsay

npm downloads the project and delete it once done
